# Nuxt Starter

This is a Nuxt Starter with several goodies that I have found really useful when I recently had to build several small applications where I was using these additions:

* Testing with Unit & E2E Setup
* Static code improvements with Linter/Prettier/Editorconfig
* Dockerfile for containerization
* Lighthouse CI for continous Software Quality audits (Performance, SEO, A11Y, Best Practices)
* Useful modules like Image, TailwindCSS, Security
* GitHub Actions Continous Integration script

Look at the [Nuxt documentation](https://nuxt.com/docs/getting-started/introduction) to learn more.

```bash
# npm
npm install

# pnpm

Start the development server on `http://localhost:3000`:

```bash

## Production

Build the application for production:

Locally preview production build:
